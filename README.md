# full-stack-app
React front end client for the api also included with this repository
Rest API application with authentication and database integration
[https://bjornlottering.online](https://bjornlottering.online/)

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
Inside both the api/ and client/ folders respectively run the following relative to these folders:
* npm install

# Inside the api folder, serve with hot reload at localhost:5000
* cd api/
* npm start

# Inside the client folder, serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
* cd client/
* npm start

Both servers need to be running at the same time for the app to become fully functional
